			<h2>World's Best Gins</h2>

			<p>Gin started out as a herbal remedy for stomach aches, gout and gallstones. It was claimed that the Dutch introduced juniper berries to flavour natural spirits to make it more palatable. Due to its subtle flavour, it is easy to mix and has become a staple alcohol of choice for a whole host of famous cocktails, including the all-time classic Martini.</p>

			<p>Here's a collection of the world's top gins. Enjoy!</p>

				<h3>Caorunn</h3>

				<img class="bottle" src="images/caorunn.jpg">
				
				<p>Caorunn Gin (pronounced "ka-roon”) is distilled in Scotland with rowan berries, which have long been a mainstay of Celtic food, drink and even medicine, and lend this gin an usually strong floral character. The perfect cooler on a hot afternoon.</p>

				<h3>Professor Cornelius Ampleforth Bathtub Gin</h3>

				<img src="images/Bathtub-Gin.jpg">
				
				<p>For something named after home-brew rocket fuel and which comes wrapped in brown paper, this is surprisingly finessed. Clean and sharp and fresh on the tongue, it’s no surprise its distiller has won more trophies than Liz Taylor.</p>

				<hr>

				<h3>Hendrick's</h3>

				<img src="images/hendricks.png">
				
				<p>With cucumber as one of the botanicals, this gin is clean, refreshing and absolutely excellent. Serve with cucumber (of course) and enjoy it in the sun. Lots of fun.</p>

				<h3>Four Pillars</h3>

				<img src="images/fourpillars.jpg">
				
				<p>Gin from Australia seems like such a sacrilege. But once you've tasted it, it is an absolute cracker, full of cinnamon and orange flavours. Little wonder it won double gold at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.</p>

				<hr>

				<h3>Hayman's 1850 Reserve</h3>

				<img src="images/haymans.png">
				
				<p>The third gin to be introduced by the Hayman's distillery this one is akin to the gin that would be served in ‘Gin Palaces’ of Victorian times. A very subtle and smooth gin with mellow notes of wood (it is rested in wood for 4 weeks).</p>

				<hr>

				<h3>Monkey 47</h3>

				<img src="images/monkey47.png">
				
				<p>An incredibly fun gin that serves the purpose of getting sozzled better than all others. Hailing from the Black Forest in Germany, the name comes from the number of botanicals that go into this unique gin, and the fact it's bottled at bedtime-inducing 47% proof. Woody, spicey, fruity and herby. Pretty much everything a gin can be.</p>
